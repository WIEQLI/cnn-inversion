PyTorch implementation of deep autoregressive nueral networks based on a dense convolutional encoder-decoder network architecture for dynamical solute transport models with a time-varying source term and for subsequent high-dimensional inverse modeling. In the network, the time-varying process is represented using an autoregressive model, in which the time-dependent output at previous time step (y<sub>{i-1})
$y_{i-1}$
